## MQTT

Open a mqtt client and after a connection send message to topic "mqttx_77b06fefjuni"

this code will work in a web browser, as long as the browser supports WebSockets. Most modern browsers do support WebSockets, but some older browsers may not. If you need to support older browsers, you may need to use a polyfill or fallback to another communication method such as long polling.

It's important to note that MQTT is a machine-to-machine communication protocol, so it is typically used for communication between devices rather than between a browser and a server. If you need to send data from a browser to a server, you may want to consider using a different communication protocol, such as WebSockets or HTTP.
